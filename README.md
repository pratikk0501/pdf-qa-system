# pdf-qa-system
* This project is titled 'PDF QA System Using Google Colab' which provides a robust pipeline for processing PDF documents, creating embeddings, and setting up a retrieval-based question-answering (QA) system using a pretrained language model.
# Project Description
* Developed a PDF-based Question Answering system in Python using Hugging Face language models to extract targeted information from uploaded documents.
* Implemented document processing pipelines that split PDFs into content chunks and generated embeddings for efficient retrieval.
* Built a retrieval-based QA system leveraging pre-trained Transformer models to deliver accurate and context-aware answers.
* Integrated a Gradio interface to provide a real-time, user-friendly platform for uploading PDFs and querying document content.
